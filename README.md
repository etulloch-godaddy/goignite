# CreatorLevel — Hackathon Build Plan (name is still in progress )
## Context

Building a gamified business-building platform for teen/young adult content creators. The platform mirrors Duolingo's habit loop: users level up their business through daily missions rather than being overwhelmed by a full business plan upfront. As users grow, they graduate into GoDaddy's product ecosystem (domain → email → business suite) — the platform acts as a structured on-ramp that pre-qualifies and onboards small creators into GoDaddy's tooling.

Scope is shaped around a hackathon sprint (~24-48h), so the build prioritises a working demo over completeness.

**Features in scope:**
- Gamified stage roadmap (Starter → Builder → Brand → Investor-Ready)
- Auto-built business profile + pitch deck
- Funding Discovery Engine
- Monetization Toolkit
- Auto-generated accomplishments dashboard
- GoDaddy stage-gate integration (simulated for hackathon)

**Features out of scope:** Audience Growth Challenges, Mentor Matching

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React + CSS + vanilla JS | User-specified; Vite for fast hackathon iteration |
| Backend | Python + FastAPI | User-specified; async, lightweight, fast to scaffold |
| AI | Claude API (`claude-sonnet-4-6`) | Powers pitch deck generation, mission personalisation |
| Data | In-memory dicts (DynamoDB Local planned) | In-memory for hackathon speed; swap to DynamoDB Local via `store.py` |
| Auth | JWT (simple, no Cognito for hackathon) | Fast to wire up |
| GoDaddy | Domains API integrated | Real API keys via `.env`; OTE test env supported via `GODADDY_OTE=true` |

## XP & Stage Progression

| Stage | XP Required | GoDaddy Gate | Focus |
|---|---|---|---|
| Starter | 0 | — | Set up brand basics |
| Builder | 300 XP | Domain registration | Build audience + products |
| Brand | 700 XP | Professional email | Revenue + media kit |
| Investor-Ready | 1500 XP | Full business suite | Pitch deck + funding apps |

Stage promotion is computed in `xp_service.py`. On promotion:
1. XP threshold crossed → `stage` field updated in store
2. Achievement auto-created: e.g. "Reached Builder Stage"
3. GoDaddy upgrade prompt surfaced in frontend

See `ACHIEVEMENTS.md` for the full catalog of all 21 achievements (titles, XP values, categories, trigger missions).

---

## AI Layer — Claude Integration

`ai_service.py` uses the Anthropic Python SDK. Two primary calls:

**1. Pitch deck generation** — triggered at Brand+ stage
- Input: user's completed missions, creator type, stated revenue goal
- Output: JSON with named sections (bio, problem, product, traction, ask) → rendered in `PitchDeck.jsx`

**2. Bio + mission personalisation** — triggered at onboarding
- Input: creator type + 3 onboarding quiz answers
- Output: personalised welcome bio + first 5 custom mission descriptions

Model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`

---

## Accomplishments Dashboard (Auto-Generated)

Every mission completion writes an achievement record via `POST /api/missions/{id}/complete`. The dashboard at `AccomplishmentsBoard.jsx` renders:

- Timeline of completed missions grouped by stage
- Impact cards (XP earned, stages reached, funding applied to)
- One-click shareable link at `/share/{user_id}` — public read-only view
- No manual updating required — driven entirely by mission completion events

This means presentations never need manual updating. Complete missions → open dashboard → share the link.

---

## Social Media & Marketing Module

`social_media_service.py` handles OAuth, platform stats, Claude content generation, and achievement writes. The full hub lives in `SocialMediaHub.jsx` across 6 tabs.

- **Platform Connect**: OAuth flow for Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook — set `MOCK_SOCIAL_APIS=true` in `.env` to bypass all external calls for demo
- **Live Stats**: Follower count, engagement rate, and recent post performance pulled per connected platform
- **Social Missions**: 19 missions across all 4 stages, filtered by creator type — completions award XP and write achievements with `category: "social_visibility"`
- **AI Content Plan**: `POST /api/social/content-ideas` calls `claude-sonnet-4-6` to generate a 7-day post calendar with hooks, captions, and hashtags; falls back to a static mock if no API key is set
- **Outreach Tracker**: Brand deal pipeline with status tracking across Starter → Investor-Ready; entries 7+ days old with status "sent" surface a follow-up reminder; closing a deal auto-fires an achievement
- **Outreach Templates + Platform Guides**: 9 copy-paste DM/email templates and IG/TikTok/FB/LinkedIn guides, all scoped by stage

Integrator adds one `include_router` call in `main.py` and one `<Route>` in `App.jsx` — no other shared files touched.

---

## GoDaddy Integration (Hackathon-Scoped)

`godaddy_service.py` returns mocked responses that mirror the real GoDaddy Domains/Email API shape. Frontend shows real upgrade flows:

- **Starter → Builder**: "Your business needs a home. Register `{brand}.com` on GoDaddy"
- **Builder → Brand**: "Go pro with `hello@{brand}.com` — GoDaddy Workspace Email"
- **Investor-Ready**: "Your pitch is ready. Launch your full site with GoDaddy Website Builder"

The full GoDaddy Domains API is integrated in `services/domains.py` (async `httpx` wrapper) with 12 endpoints in `routes/domains.py`. Auth via `sso-key` header; OTE test environment controlled by `GODADDY_OTE=true` in `.env`.

**Required env vars:**
```
GODADDY_API_KEY=
GODADDY_API_SECRET=
GODADDY_OTE=true   # set false for production
```

---

## Build Order (Hackathon Sprint)

### Phase 1 — Foundation ✓
1. ✓ Scaffold `backend/` with FastAPI + basic user + mission routes
2. Scaffold `frontend/` with Vite + React Router + global styles
3. Wire `api.js` fetch wrapper (base URL from `VITE_API_URL`)

### Phase 2 — Core Loop ✓
4. ✓ Onboarding quiz → creator type → user created in store
5. ✓ Mission list + completion endpoint + XP bar
6. ✓ Stage promotion logic in `xp_service.py`

### Phase 3 — AI + Profile
7. Claude pitch deck generation (`ai_service.py` + `PitchDeck.jsx`)
8. ✓ Accomplishments dashboard (achievement writes on mission complete)
9. Auto-bio generation at onboarding

### Phase 4 — Discovery + Monetisation
10. ✓ Funding Engine — `funding.json` (15 opportunities) + `GET /api/funding` with stage + creator_type filtering
11. Monetization Toolkit — static guides + template downloads

### Phase 5 — GoDaddy + Polish
12. ✓ GoDaddy Domains API integrated (`services/domains.py`, `routes/domains.py`)
12. GoDaddy stage-gate prompts (frontend)
13. Shareable accomplishments link (`/share/{user_id}`)
14. Demo seed data + walkthrough script for presentation
